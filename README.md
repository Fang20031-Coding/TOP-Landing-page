## Notes
### 17:25 24/06/2025 (UTC +7): 
Finished html and styling. Struggled with this at first because I worried too much about how to make a "perfect, industry standard" webpage. But thanks to [!This](https://dev.to/theodinproject/pursuing-best-practices-is-a-bad-practice-when-youre-new-37pb) that I gained a new understanding on the learning mindset now. It did help a lot on my session in the afternoon. 
A few things I need to work on is commit more often or how should I tackle each problem. Like how I should do each html sections then it's styling one-by-one or do all the html then styling later. I did go back and forth between html and css a lot today because I realize I didn't give myself enough container for flexbox styling (Am I depend too much on flexbox now? Will that become a bad practice?)
